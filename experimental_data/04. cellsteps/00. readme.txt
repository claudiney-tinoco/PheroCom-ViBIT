% 1. Title: 
%		Cellsteps Experimental Data
%
% 2. Description: 
%		Cellsteps maps aim to graphically show the scattering of the 
%		swarm across the environment. It is possible to observe whether 
%		the spread is homogeneous or whether there are areas not being 
%		monitored at an adequate frequency. Each time a robot passes 
%		through a cell, a cellstep is counted. These maps describe the 
%		mean of 100 executions to avoid outliers.
%
% 3. File information:
%		The name of the datasets consists of the following information:
%
%		[number]. data_[exper]_e[[envir]-[envir-size]]_[swarm-size]rb_[choice-strategy]
%
%		-> number: number of the file;
%		-> exper: type of the experiment [cs = Cellstep];
%		-> envir: number of the environment [1];
%		-> envir-size: dimensions of the environment;
%		-> swarm-size: number of robots composing the swarm;
%		-> choice-strategy: distribution of the movement strategies [1]
%			(222) = all robots with deterministic strategy
%			(555) = all robots with inertial strategy
%			(552) = 2/3 with inertial and 1/3 with deterministic strategy
%
% 4. Data information:
%		The data describe a matrix with the same dimensions of the 
%		environment. Each value of this matrix represents the mean of 
%		cellsteps of a cell that composes the grid that discretizes the 
%		environment. Cells representing stationary objects, such as walls, 
%		do not receive cellsteps.
