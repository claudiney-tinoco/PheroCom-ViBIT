% 1. Title: 
%		Task Points Experimental Data
%
% 2. Description: 
%		Task points charts show how many times the proposed task has 
%		been completed, given a maximum amount of time steps. In this
%		case, the task defined was surveillance.
%
%		The formal definition of task points [1] is as follows:
%		"Let E be an environment composed of ‘m’ rooms and S a swarm 
%		composed of ‘n’ robots. A room 'i' belonging to the environment 
%		E is described as {r_i/(i <= m) and (i in N)}. Similarly, a 
%		robot 'i' belonging to the swarm S is described as {s_i/(i <= n) 
%		and (i in N)}. Thus, a task point is reached iff every room 
%		(r_i in E) receives a visit from at least one robot (s_i in S)."
%
% 3. File information:
%		The name of the datasets consists of the following information:
%
%		[number]. data_[exper]_e[[envir]-[envir-size]]_[swarm-size]rb_[choice-strategy]
%
%		-> number: number of the file;
%		-> exper: type of the experiment [tp = Task Point];
%		-> envir: number of the environment [1];
%		-> envir-size: dimensions of the environment;
%		-> swarm-size: number of robots composing the swarm;
%		-> choice-strategy: distribution of the movement strategies [1]
%			(222) = all robots with deterministic strategy
%			(555) = all robots with inertial strategy
%			(552) = 2/3 with inertial and 1/3 with deterministic strategy
%
% 4. Data information:
%		The data is arranged in a 22-column, 100-row table. Each column 
%		represents a different setup, and each row an execution with a 
%		different random seed, i.e., each of the 22 setups has run 100 
%		times. The first column contains the data from the experiments 
%		using the IACA-DI model, and the other columns with the PheroCom 
%		coordination model, varying the robots' communication radius.
%
%		Column 01 = IACA-DI [2]
%		Column 02 = PheroCom (radius 0) [1]
%		Column 03 = PheroCom (radius 1) [1]
%		Column 04 = PheroCom (radius 2) [1]
