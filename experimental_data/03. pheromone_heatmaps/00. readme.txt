% 1. Title: 
%		Pheromone Heatmaps Experimental Data
%
% 2. Description: 
%		Pheromone heatmaps present the concentration of pheromone 
%		throughout the environment at a given time step, i.e., a screenshot 
%		that shows the amount of pheromone spread in each analysed area.
%
% 3. File information:
%		The name of the datasets consists of the following information:
%
%		[number]. data_[exper]_e[[envir]-[envir-size]]_[swarm-size]rb_[choice-strategy]_rb[rb-id]_rad[radius]
%
%		-> number: number of the file;
%		-> exper: type of the experiment [ph = Pheromone Heatmap];
%		-> envir: number of the environment [1];
%		-> envir-size: dimensions of the environment;
%		-> swarm-size: number of robots composing the swarm;
%		-> choice-strategy: distribution of the movement strategies [1]
%			(222) = all robots with deterministic strategy
%			(555) = all robots with inertial strategy
%			(552) = 2/3 with inertial and 1/3 with deterministic strategy;
%		-> rb-id: the 'id' of the robot that owns the heatmap;
%		-> radius: communication radius used by the robots in the experiment
%
% 4. Data information:
%		The data describe a matrix with the same dimensions of the environment.
%		Each value of this matrix represents the concentration of pheromone in 
%		one of the cells that are in the grid that discretizes the environment.
%		The values range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents no pheromone
%		detected and 1.0 the maximum amount of pheromone. Cells representing 
%		stationary objects, such as walls, do not receive deposits of pheromone. 
%		Therefore, in the pheromone grid, this type of cell always maintains base
%		values (0.000010).
